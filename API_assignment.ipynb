It uses the XML format of data to transfer messages over the HTTP protocol. In Web services, SOAP allows the user request to interact with other programming languages.

It is a set of constraints used to create a lightweight, scalable and maintainable web service that makes easy communication with each other. All web services are based on the REST; hence it is called a RESTful service. The purpose of developing a RESTful web service is to make the web service more effective.
