    "In Python, an Exception is a type of error that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts \n",
    "the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are typically caused by various kinds of errors \n",
    "or exceptional conditions, such as a division by zero, attempting to access an invalid memory address, or \n",
    "trying to read from a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference between Exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when there is an issue \n",
    "with the structure of the code itself, such as a missing colon, a misplaced parenthesis, or a typo in a \n",
    "keyword. On the other hand, Exceptions are raised when the code is syntactically correct, but encounters \n",
    "an error during runtime that prevents it from executing properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that syntax errors are usually easy to spot, and Python will typically raise them as \n",
    "soon as it encounters them during compilation. Exceptions, however, may not be immediately apparent, and \n",
    "may require some troubleshooting to identify and fix the underlying issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an Exception is raised during program execution, Python will typically stop the program and display \n",
    "an error message that provides information about what caused the Exception to occur. The error message will\n",
    "often include a traceback, which shows the sequence of function calls that led up to the Exception being \n",
    "raised, as well as the line of code that triggered it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Exceptions are a type of error that occur during program execution in Python, typically caused\n",
    "by unexpected or exceptional conditions, whereas syntax errors occur when there is a problem with the \n",
    "structure or syntax of the code itself."
