    "Definition: Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two variables vary together, while correlation\n",
    "measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: Covariance can take on any value, positive or negative, while correlation values always range between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Units: Covariance is measured in the units of the two variables, while correlation is a unitless measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Covariance can be difficult to interpret, as its value depends on the units of the variables \n",
    "being measured. On the other hand, correlation values are standardized and can be easily compared across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, covariance and correlation are different measures that serve different purposes. Covariance \n",
    "measures how two variables are related to one another, while correlation measures how strong that relationship\n",
    "is and in what direction it goes. The correlation coefficient can be used to determine whether the relationship\n",
    "between the two variables is positive, negative or non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, correlation is generally preferred over covariance because it is more interpretable and\n",
    "standardized. Correlation coefficients range between -1 and 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation,\n",
    "0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. This makes it easier to compare the \n",
    "relationship between different variables."

    "Outliers are data points that lie far away from the other data points in a dataset, either at the high end\n",

    "Standard deviation: sqrt(1802.22) = 42.47\n",
    "The standard deviation is also increased due to the large squared distance between the outlier and the mean.\n",
